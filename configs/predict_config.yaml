predict:
    test_ds: # path to the input file with contigs in fasta format
    weights: # path to the folder containing weights for NN and RF modules trained on 500 and 1000 fragment lengths
    out_path: # path to the folder to store predictions
    n_cpus: # number of cpus you want to use
    return_viral: # (True/False) True if you want to recuperate contigs annotated as viral
    limit: 750 # Do predictions only for contigs > l. We suggest default l=750, as it was tested in the paper
